simple deflator to be used with Arduino 
Sure, I can explain how the final python compressor code works on an example of compressing a short text file. Here are the steps:

- First, the code reads the text file as bytes and converts it to a list of integers. For example, if the text file contains the word "Hello", the corresponding list of integers would be [72, 101, 108, 108, 111].

- Next, the code creates a frequency table for the data using a common denominator. The frequency table maps each unique data element to its frequency (number of occurrences) in the data. The common denominator is the greatest common divisor of all data elements. For example, if the data is [72, 101, 108, 108, 111], the frequency table would be {72: 1, 101: 1, 108: 2, 111: 1} and the common denominator would be 1.

- Then, the code finds the optimal base size using heuristics based on data size and variability. The base size is the size of the custom number base that will be used to encode the data. The heuristics consider the total size of the data, the maximum and minimum values of the data, the mean and standard deviation of the data, and the maximum base size (256). For example, if the data is [72, 101, 108, 108, 111], the total size is 5 bytes, the maximum value is 111, the minimum value is 72, the mean value is 96, and the standard deviation is 15.6. The heuristics may choose a base size of 40 based on these values.

- After that, the code creates a custom multiplication table for the base size. The multiplication table is a matrix of base size x base size that contains the product of each pair of numbers from 1 to base size. For example, if the base size is 40, the multiplication table would be a matrix with rows and columns from 1 to 40 and each element being the product of its row and column indices.

- Next, the code iterates over a number of trials to find the optimal frequency table and multiplication table using a hill-climbing algorithm. The hill-climbing algorithm starts with an initial frequency table and multiplication table and tries to find a better pair by swapping two keys or values in the frequency table or two rows or columns in the multiplication table at each iteration. The algorithm evaluates each pair by encoding each data element using the frequency table and multiplication table and calculating the compression ratio (the ratio of original size to compressed size). The algorithm keeps track of the best compression ratio and updates it if it finds a better pair. For example, if the initial frequency table is {72: 1, 101: 1, 108: 2, 111: 1} and

Okay, I'll continue the explanation:

- For example, if the initial frequency table is {72: 1, 101: 1, 108: 2, 111: 1} and the initial multiplication table is a matrix with rows and columns from 1 to 40 and each element being the product of its row and column indices, the algorithm may choose to swap the keys 72 and 111 in the frequency table and get a new frequency table {111: 1, 101: 1, 108: 2, 72: 1}. Then it may encode each data element using the new frequency table and the same multiplication table and get a new compression ratio. If the new compression ratio is better than or equal to the previous one, the algorithm updates the best compression ratio and the best frequency table and multiplication table. Otherwise, it discards the new pair and tries another swap.

- The algorithm repeats this process for a maximum number of iterations or until it reaches a local optimum. The final output of the algorithm is the best compression ratio and the best frequency table and multiplication table.

- Finally, the code writes the best frequency table, the common denominator, the best multiplication table and the base size to a header file. The header file contains an array of integers that stores these parameters in a specific order. For example, if the best frequency table is {111: 1, 101: 1, 108: 2, 72: 1}, the common denominator is 1, the best multiplication table is a matrix with rows and columns from 1 to 40 and each element being the product of its row and column indices, and the base size is 40, the header file would contain an array of integers as follows:

```c

const int common_h[] = {1, // The common denominator

                        40, // The base size

                        111, // The first key of the frequency table

                        101, // The second key of the frequency table

                        ... // The remaining keys of the frequency table

                        1, // The first value of the frequency table

                        1, // The second value of the frequency table

                        ... // The remaining values of the frequency table

                        1, // The first element of the multiplication table

                        ... // The remaining elements of the multiplication table in row-major order

                       };

```

- The code also writes each encoded file data to a separate header file using the best frequency table and multiplication table with variable-length codes. The header file contains an array of bytes that stores the encoded data. To encode each data element using variable-length codes, the code uses unary coding for the frequency and binary coding for the modulo. For example, if a data element has a frequency of 3 and a modulo of 25 in base size 40, its encoded value would be (3 - 1) ones followed by a zero followed by a byte representation of 25. In binary format, this would be:

```c

110000011001

```

- In byte format, this would be:

```c

00011000 // The first byte (padded with zeros on left)

00110010 // The second byte (padded with zeros on right)

```

- The code writes these two bytes to the header file as follows:

```c

const byte file_h[] = {0x18, // The first byte in hexadecimal format

                       ... // The remaining bytes of encoded data

                      };

```


Okay, I can explain how the data is decoded by the Arduino code. Here are the steps:

- First, the Arduino code reads the common parameters from the common header file. These include the common denominator, the base size, the frequency table keys and values, and the multiplication table values. The code stores these parameters in global variables for later use.

- Next, the Arduino code loops over each compressed file and decompresses it using the frequency table, the multiplication table and the base size with variable-length codes. The code reads each byte from the compressed file and extracts each bit from it. The code uses an index variable to keep track of the current position in the compressed file byte array and a bit index variable to keep track of the current position in the current byte.

- For each data element in the compressed file, the code first reads its frequency using unary coding until a zero bit is encountered. The code uses a frequency variable to store the frequency of each data element. For example, if the first byte is 00011000 and the bit index is 7, the code reads 0 as the first bit and increments the bit index to 6. Then it reads 0 as the second bit and increments the bit index to 5. Then it reads 0 as the third bit and increments the bit index to 4. Then it reads 1 as the fourth bit and increments both the frequency variable and the bit index to 1. Then it reads 1 as the fifth bit and increments both the frequency variable and the bit index to 2. Then it reads 0 as the sixth bit and stops reading frequency and decrements

Okay, I'll continue the explanation:

- For each data element in the compressed file, the code first reads its frequency using unary coding until a zero bit is encountered. The code uses a frequency variable to store the frequency of each data element. For example, if the first byte is 00011000 and the bit index is 7, the code reads 0 as the first bit and increments the bit index to 6. Then it reads 0 as the second bit and increments the bit index to 5. Then it reads 0 as the third bit and increments the bit index to 4. Then it reads 1 as the fourth bit and increments both the frequency variable and the bit index to 1. Then it reads 1 as the fifth bit and increments both the frequency variable and the bit index to 2. Then it reads 0 as the sixth bit and stops reading frequency and decrements the bit index to 3.

- Next, the code reads its modulo using binary coding as a byte. The code uses a modulo variable to store the modulo of each data element. For example, if the first byte is 00011000 and the second byte is 00110010 and the bit index is 3, the code reads 1000 as the remaining bits of the first byte and sets the modulo variable to 8. Then it moves to the next byte and sets the bit index to 7. Then it reads 00110010 as the bits of the second byte and sets the modulo variable to (8 << 8) + 50 = 2058.

- Then, the code decodes its value using frequency table and multiplication table. The code uses a mult variable to store the corresponding value from the multiplication table using frequency and modulo. For example, if the frequency variable is 2 and the modulo variable is 2058 and the base size is 40, the code reads pgm_read_word_near(common_h + freq * base_size + mod % base_size + 2 + base_size * 2) as mult. This means that it reads from the common header file at an offset of (2 * 40 + (2058 % 40) + 2 + (40 * 2)) * sizeof(int) = (82 + (40 * 2)) * sizeof(int) = (162) * sizeof(int) = (162) * (2) = (324) bytes. The value at this offset is mult = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h + (324)) = pgm_read_word_near(common_h
